# Project: Toonch-i Store E-Commerce Website


## Description
Project aims to create an e-commerce website site page.


## Problem Statement
- My company has recently started on a project that aims to create an e-commerce website page. The project was requested to be completed by December 31th, 2020. 

- The project should preferably be created on React. The application should include the following functions. Listing customers, viewing customer details, listing orders and viewing order details. 

- The State method should be selected globally.

- Orders and customers should be able to be filtered / searchable. (client-side)

- Orders and customers should be accessible on separate screens and referenced items should also be accessible. For example, a customer's orders should be listed and order details can be 
accessed from here.

- The components to be used for functionality should be a minimum and complement all functionality.

- The selection of the components to be used for the interface to be created belongs to the project owner.

- The screens should be comfortable for the end user.
